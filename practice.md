## Assignment

Prepare a comprehensive report in LaTeX, addressing the following points:

1. **Historical Context and Modern Applications**
   - Identify the modern machine learning technique or algorithm that corresponds to the theory presented in your chosen classic paper.
   - Analyze the differences between the original interpretations and current implementations.

2. **Critical Analysis of Modern Research**
   - Summarize the main arguments or hypotheses presented in your chosen modern paper(s).
   - Evaluate the methods used to validate these hypotheses.
   - Assess the consistency between the hypothesis, experimental design, and conclusions.

3. **Biological Foundations in AI Development**
   - Develop a thesis on whether future AI systems should have a biological basis.
   - Propose and defend principles for devising AI algorithms.
   - Support your arguments with rigorous logic and relevant examples.

4. **Personal Insights and Reflections**
   - Share any additional thoughts, critiques, or ideas inspired by your readings.
   - Discuss potential implications for future AI research and development.

## Submission Guidelines

- Format: LaTeX document (PDF)	
- Length: **4 pages** minimal (not including reference), but aim for conciseness and clarity
- Citations: Use proper academic citations for all referenced works

## Evaluation Criteria

Your report will be assessed based on:
- Depth of understanding of both classic and modern papers (30 points)
- Critical thinking and analytical skills (20 points)
- Clarity and coherence of arguments (20 points)
- Creativity and originality in proposed ideas (20 points)
- Proper use of LaTeX and academic writing conventions (10 points)

This assignment is designed to challenge you to engage deeply with foundational and cutting-edge concepts in AI and cognitive science. It encourages you to think critically about the evolution of AI theories and their practical applications.
